# Add Public Keys

This will add public keys, as generated by `ssh-keygen`, to the
`authorized_keys` file on a centos host.

## Usage

First, copy and public keys you wish to port over into the `pubkeys`
directory. You can call them whatever you like, but the file extension
must be `.pub`.

e.g.

    cp ~/.ssh/my_pub_key.pub ./pubkeys

When you're ready to run the playbook, call `vagrant up` and then call
`vagrant provision` as often as you'd like after that.
